- Introductory jupyter notebook going over:
- - how to import and work with images as data in python
- - how to make your own CNN in pytorch for classification (very simple one on the MINST dataset) 
- - how to finetune an existing CNN, and where to find pretrained CNNs 

- Discussion of the technical aspects (the book) 
- - anything that does not add up? 
- - do we understand or agree upon when it makes sense to use CNNs and what CNNs can be used for in social science? 

- Discussions of applied work (the paper) 
- - What do you think of the paper? 
- - Can you use this in your own research - and how?
