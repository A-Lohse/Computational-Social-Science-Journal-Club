# Computational-Social-Science-Journal-Club
Computational Social Science Journal Club for Ph.D students at SODAS in UCPH 

## Description and schedule 
In the Computational Social Science Journal Club we read and discuss varies methodological and applied approaches within Computational Social Science (CSS). We take time to understand the theory behind a CSS approach, and allow ourselves to be inspired by the applied work by others. We meet every 3 weeks for 3 hours, and work with a topic. The Schedule is usually determined by the "After hours drinks" event in outlook, though I have move some dates. An outlook event should be in your calender, please accept or reject based on attendance.  

The dates for this semester are:
- 17th of March (13-16 small meeting room): August - Images as data
- 31rd of March (13-16 small meeting room):
- 21nd of April (13.30-16.30 small meeting room): Malene, something with NLP
- 12th of May (13-16 small meeting room): Johanna - Bayesian Statistics
- 2nd of June (13.30-16.30 small meeting room): 


## Content of sessions
Each sessions will be prepared by a member of the journal club. The reading material should be ready at least a week before the date of the meeting, to allow everyone time to read. We aim that each sessions should contain:
- 1-2 papers on the theory of a method/approach
- 1-2 papers on the applied approahc 
- A list of papers that are relevant if you want to dive deeper into the topic (just use whatever paper you found, but did not use, if they are good ofc.) 
- Some sort of presentation, exercise or practical demonstration. This could for example be a presentation by some SODAS faculty using the method, or a notebook demonstrating how to use it 

## Sign up to prepare
If you want to sign up to prepare a session do the following:
- Send me (August) an email
- Make a commit with your name and the topic under schedule
- Update the appropriate folder name to month-day-year-topic, with your chosen topic 
- prepare :)

## Participation without commitment
It is possible to join our mailinglist, and attend the meetings that are of most relevance to you. I do not know yet, if it is possible to recieve ECTS or workhours, if you do not participate fully, but I will look into it. 


## The formal stuff
I am currently working with Ingo to figure out the details, but until then we can just do the journal clubs. 

## Wishlist for topics:
You are more than welcome to add to this list at anytime 

List of topics:
- Bayesian statistics
- Best practice coding, version control (GIT) and latex (overleaf)
- Causal inference (dif-n-dif & RDD) (interperet regressions)
- Causal machine learning  
- Cognitive signals in NLP
- Dimensionality reduction
- Embeddings (words etc.)
- Images as data
- Machine learning / evaluation of machine learning (SHAP & permutation)
- Model optimization/saturation -  (in ML/DL/NLP)
- Network analysis (visualization, inference etc.)
- Non-inference (thinking outside of inference)
- Scraping and APIs (and available online trace data)
- Unsupervised learning (mainly in NLP such as topic models)
- Visualization (in terms of  Best practice and journal choice)
